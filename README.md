# Ragtime Generator
> My first exploration into basic music generation using neural networks.

A simple LSTM-based music generator in the style of ragtime music.
Data currently comes from [here](https://github.com/tylerdoll/music-generator/tree/74d9615016650ee8c1a75d75a4880c6ea1c1eda5).

I'll write some proper instructions and clean up the source files at some point.

tl;dr The current approach I have tried generates simple notes that sound... "modern"... but do not sound like ragtime.  Many of the articles online use naive methods and likewise sound nothing like ragtime.  I'll write some detail here at some point explaining why, particularly surrounding the structure and form of ragtime and why just brute forcing for patterns doesn't work.
