# Ragtime Generator
> My first exploration into basic music generation using neural networks.

A simple LSTM-based music generator in the style of ragtime music.
Data currently comes from [here](https://github.com/tylerdoll/music-generator/tree/74d9615016650ee8c1a75d75a4880c6ea1c1eda5).

I'll write some proper instructions and clean up the source files at some point.
